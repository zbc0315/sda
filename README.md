# SDA

SDA is an unsupervised approach to mine chemical data from literatures.

## 1. Requirements

#### 1.1 Python 3.6 or higher

#### 1.2 Others
```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## 2. Literature Data

#### 2.1 Abstract

Chemical entities and their functions can be extracted from the abstract. The abstracts can be downloaded via webofscience.

The abstract exported from webofscience should be in the **tab delimited format(1)** and contain **abstract(2)** as shown in follow:
![wos.png](wos.png)

The abstract exported from webofscience should be preprocessed by the following command:
```bash
python ./data_preprocess/paper_extractor.py
python ./data_preprocess/text_extractor.py
```

#### 2.2 Main Body/Supplement Information

Experimental procedure that contain chemical entities, properties and chemical operations can be extracted from the main body or the supplement information of the literature.

The main body and the supplement information of the literature should be in the PDF format.

The PDFs download please follow the specifications of each journal.

The PDFs should be preprocessed by the following command:

```bash
python ./data_preprocess/pdf_paper_extractor.py
python ./data_preprocess/text_extractor.py
```
